# Assessing the Performance of Pretrained Models for Accurate and Consistent Classification of Argument Structure Constructions
================================================================================

### Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of 8 sub-datasets with a total of 19,853 clauses, all (semi-)annotated for constructions by human coders with linguistics training.

### Sub-Datasets

#### Datasets created for this project

* One dataset from journal articles in the American National Corpus
* One dataset from speech data of English language learners
* One curated dataset from published research on sentence patterns, with 100 example sentences for each of 10 constructions

#### Datasets transfromed from the English Argument Structure Constructions Treebank (Sung and Kyle, 2024)

* Five datasets from the English Argument Structure Constructions Treebank, covering 5 web registers:
	+ Blogs
	+ Emails
	+ Newsgroups
	+ Reviews
	+ Yahoo Answers
